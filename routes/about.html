              The project has now been updated to include the google maps API to show locations to local KC BBQ restaurants. This has now been fixed although it was not working during the poresentation. There are more features that can now be added as this has been fixed.

              Though the original version of this project has been fixed, there are a few other features I would like to add. I would like to be able to add new restaurants to the database and I had been looking into Google authentication in order to have an account system to mark off which restaurants had been visited.

              The project would likelly verge into back-end territory which is beyond the original scope of this project (something I will do on my own time). As I do want to finish this project to be what I had envisioned, I will continune working on it on my own free time. Thanks for looking at this project (the first completed orignal project.)
